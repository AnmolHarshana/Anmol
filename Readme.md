# Learning Version Control

Some Terms as I understood:

Remote: Stored at the server or not present at your location(literally)

Clone: Copying the repository from the server to remote PC or even another server

Local: Stored on your device.

Push: importing changes from the local repository to remote repository

Repository: Not exactly a folder, a version control unit
